# Retro-Jets

> This is a fighter jet game made in python and pygame with sound effect and images.
> Unfortunately you have to install python and pygame for the game to run.
> Soon in the future the game will be an executable and there will be no need for installing.

**WARNING**: don't delete anything in the assets folder becuase it contains important files and make sure the exe is not some where else for the application to work.

>Enjoy!
